deleting OData resources in Angular.\nOData service for Angular.\nPlease check also my other related project, OData Angular Generator\nInstall:\nnpm i angular-odataDemo:\nFull examples of the library:\n\nAngularODataEntity\n\nUsage:\nSimple usage: Service Factory\nIn this mode the services are obtained from a factory and optionally we can use types for entities\n1) Add module to your

Custom Services\nIn this mode, services are created using custom definitions and corresponding configuration\n1) The entity with configuration\nimport { PersonGender } from './persongender.enum';\nimport { Location  } from './location.entity';\nimport { Photo } from './photo.entity';\nimport { Trip } from './trip.entity';\n\nexport interface Person {\n  UserName:

EntityConfig;2) The api configuration \nimport ...\nimport { PersonGenderConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/persongender.enum.config';\nimport { LocationConfig } from

from './person.entity';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class PeopleService extends ODataEntityService {\n  constructor(protected client: ODataClient) {\n    super(client, 'People',

TripPinConfig, PeopleService } from './trippin';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot(TripPinConfig)\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    PeopleService\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}5) Inject and use the entity service\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataClient } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { PeopleService, PhotosService } from

import the config and the module from generated source.\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { ODataModule } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { TripPinConfig, TripPinModule } from
