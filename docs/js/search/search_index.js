Custom Services\nIn this mode, services are created using custom definitions and corresponding configuration\n1) The entity with configuration\nimport { PersonGender } from './persongender.enum';\nimport { Location  } from './location.entity';\nimport { Photo } from './photo.entity';\nimport { Trip } from './trip.entity';\n\nexport interface Person {\n  UserName:

EntityConfig;2) The api configuration \nimport ...\nimport { PersonGenderConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/persongender.enum.config';\nimport { LocationConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/location.entity.config';\nimport { PhotoConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/photo.entity.config';\nimport { PersonConfig }

TripPinConfig, PeopleService } from './trippin';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot(TripPinConfig)\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    PeopleService\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}5) Inject and use the entity service\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataClient } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { PeopleService } from './trippin';\n\n@Component({\n

the config and the module from generated source.\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { ODataModule } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { TripPinConfig, TripPinModule } from './trippin';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot(TripPinConfig),\n    TripPinModule\n  ]\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule {}OData V3 and V2\nThe library works mainly with
