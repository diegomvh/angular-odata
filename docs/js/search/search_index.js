related project, OData Angular Generator\nInstall:\nnpm i angular-odataDemo:\nFull examples of the library:\n\nAngularODataEntity\n\nUsage:\nSimple usage: Service Factory\nIn this mode the services are obtained from a factory and optionally we can use types for entities\n1) Add module to your project\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataModule } from 'angular-odata';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot({\n      serviceRootUrl: 'https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(4m0tuxtnhcfctl4gzem3gr10))/TripPinServiceRW/'\n    })\n    ...\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}or build settings through a factory function.\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { ODataModule, ODataSettings } from 'angular-odata';\n\nexport function settingsFactory() {\n  return new ODataSettings({\n    serviceRootUrl: 'https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(4m0tuxtnhcfctl4gzem3gr10))/TripPinServiceRW/'\n  });\n}\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule\n  ]\n  providers: [\n    ...\n    { provide: ODataSettings, useFactory: settingsFactory }\n  ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}2) Inject and use the ODataServiceFactory\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataClient, ODATA_ETAG } from 'angular-odata';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'TripPin';\n  constructor(private factory: ODataServiceFactory) {\n    this.queries();\n  }\n\n  queries() {\n    // Use OData Service Factory\n    let airportsService = this.factory.entity(\"Airports\", 'Microsoft.OData.SampleService.Models.TripPin.Airport');\n    let peopleService = this.factory.entity(\"People\", 'Microsoft.OData.SampleService.Models.TripPin.Person');\n\n    let airports = airportsService.entities();\n\n    // Fetch all airports\n    airports\n    .all()\n    .subscribe(aports => console.log(\"All: \", aports));\n\n    // Fetch airports with count\n    airports\n    .get({withCount: true})\n    .subscribe(({entities, meta}) => console.log(\"Airports: \", entities,

entity with configuration\nimport { PersonGender } from './persongender.enum';\nimport { Location  } from './location.entity';\nimport { Photo } from './photo.entity';\nimport { Trip } from './trip.entity';\n\nexport interface Person {\n  UserName: string;\n  FirstName: string;\n  LastName: string;\n  Emails?: string[];\n  AddressInfo?: Location[];\n  Gender?: PersonGender;\n

EntityConfig;2) The api configuration \nimport ...\nimport { PersonGenderConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/persongender.enum.config';\nimport { LocationConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/location.entity.config';\nimport { PhotoConfig } from './Microsoft/OData/SampleService/Models/TripPin/photo.entity.config';\nimport { PersonConfig }

from './person.entity';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class PeopleService extends ODataEntityService {\n  constructor(protected client: ODataClient) {\n    super(client, 'People', 'Microsoft.OData.SampleService.Models.TripPin.Person');\n  }\n}4) Add module to your project\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataModule } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { TripPinConfig, PeopleService } from './trippin';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot(TripPinConfig)\n    ...\n  ],\n  providers: [\n    PeopleService\n  ]\n})\nexport class AppModule {}5) Inject and use the entity service\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { ODataClient } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { PeopleService, PhotosService } from './trippin';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-root',\n  templateUrl: './app.component.html',\n  styleUrls: ['./app.component.css']\n})\nexport class AppComponent {\n  title = 'AngularODataEntity';\n

 this.photos.entity(person.Photo)\n        .media()\n        .blob().subscribe(console.log);\n      }\n    });\n  }\n}Advanced usage: OData Generator\n1) If you choose using OData Angular Generator, import the config and the module from generated source.\nimport { NgModule } from '@angular/core';\n\nimport { ODataModule } from 'angular-odata';\nimport { TripPinConfig, TripPinModule } from './trippin';\n\n@NgModule({\n  imports: [\n    ...\n    ODataModule.forRoot(TripPinConfig),\n    TripPinModule\n  ]\n  ...\n})\nexport class AppModule {}OData V3 and V2\nThe library works mainly with OData V4, however, it incorporates basic support for versions 3 and 2.\nQueries\nFor a deep query customizations the library use odata-query as a builder.\n\nOData v4 query
